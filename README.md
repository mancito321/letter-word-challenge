**Code Challenge Instructions**
“In the programming language of your choice, write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer. 

Examples: 

“Smooth” becomes “S3h” 
“Space separated” becomes “S3e s5d” 
“Dash-separated” becomes “D2h-s5d” 
“Number2separated” becomes “N4r2s5d”
